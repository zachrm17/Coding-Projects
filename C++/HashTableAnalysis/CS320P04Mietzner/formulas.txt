load factor = (# of entered elements) / (table size)
unsuccessful probing for separate chaining is theoretically (1 + load factor)
successful probing for separate chaining is theoretically (1 + (load factor / 2))
successful probing for linear is theoretically 0.5*(1 + (1 / (1 - load factor)))
unsuccessful probing for linear is theoretically 0.5*(1 + (1 / (1 - load factor)^2))
