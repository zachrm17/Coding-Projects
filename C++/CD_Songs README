//PROGRAM SPECIFICATIONS

Song.h / Song.cpp
- Song.h should define a "Song" class with the functions necessary to create, display and destroy individual songs.  
- A song is hereby defined as being a string data type containing the name of the song and a second string containing the length of the song. 
- Song.cpp should implement these functions

Songs.h / Songs.cpp
- Songs.h should define a class designed to hold a large amount variables of the Song data type. 
- The total number of Song in a collection will be passed by the user when Songs is created.  
- Functions for creating, displaying and destroying Songs structures should be included in the .h file. 
- In addition, a helper function to add a created song to the end of your current Songs variable should also be included. 
- These functions should all be implemented in the Songs.cpp file

CD.h / CD.cpp 
- CD.h should define a "CD" class  with the functions necessary to create, display and destroy individual CD. 
- The functions should be implemented in the CD.cpp file.  
- A CD is hereby defined as holding (please note this is the same order they are stored in the file): 

A Title
An Artist
A Release Date
A Rating
A Number of Songs
A Collection of individual songs

CDs.h / CDs.cpp
- CDs.h should define a "CDs" class with the functions necessary to create, display and destroy a large number of individual CD variables. 
- An important thing to note is that the total number of CD should be unknown, so the easiest solution will be to start at a relatively small size (say 2) and then have the array double in size as necessary, so a resize function is also going to be necessary.  
- To make this work, the create function should take the filename containing all the CD information as its only parameter. A final 2 functions will allow us to search the finished structure. 
- These functions should be overloaded, with one accepting the name of a particular band and returning all albums by that band. 
- The second function should take in a rating and return all albums with a rating greater than OR equal to that rating.

Driver.cpp
- This should be a program that reads in the name of the text file containing the cds (cds.txt in our example but this could change) then it should loop through a menu allowing the user to search the newly created database or terminate the program. 
- If the user chooses to end, they should be given a nice goodbye message and all data should be cleared from memory before the program ends.
